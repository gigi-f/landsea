# Copilot Instructions

## Documentation Maintenance
- **CRITICAL**: Whenever you add, remove, or change a game control or input binding, you MUST update `CONTROLS.md` to reflect the change immediately.
- Keep the documentation simple and player-facing.

## Code Style
- Follow existing Java patterns in the codebase.
- Use LibGDX classes where appropriate.
